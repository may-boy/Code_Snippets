React Fundamentals
React Core Concepts: Learn about JSX, components, props, state, and the component lifecycle.
Hooks: Understand hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer for state management and side effects in
functional components.
Routing: Use React Router for navigation within your application.
State Management
Context API: Manage global state using the Context API.
Redux: Dive deeper into state management with Redux and middleware like Redux Thunk or Saga for asynchronous actions.
Advanced React
Performance Optimization: Learn techniques to optimize performance, including memoization, lazy loading, and
virtualization.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
TypeScript with React: Understand the benefits of using TypeScript for type safety and how to integrate it with React
projects.
