# Code_Snippets

This repository contains the regular problems that I solve in order to enhance my skill set.

Java Development Learning Path
Core Java Concepts
Advanced Object-Oriented Programming: Deep dive into polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Java Collections Framework: Master the use of List, Set, Map, and Queue interfaces and their implementations.
Generics: Understand how to use generic types for stronger type checks at compile time.
Functional Programming: Learn about lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and the Stream API.
Concurrency and Multithreading: Explore threads, synchronization, the java.util.concurrent package, and the Java Memory
Model.
Java I/O and NIO: Get a grip on Java's input and output mechanisms, including the New I/O (NIO) for more efficient file
handling.
Exception Handling: Deepen your understanding of try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and best practices.
Java Ecosystem and Tools
Build Tools: Familiarize yourself with Maven and Gradle for project management and builds.
Unit Testing: Learn JUnit, Mockito for testing, and understand test-driven development (TDD).
Version Control: Become proficient in using Git and GitHub for source code management.
Java Frameworks and Libraries
Spring Framework: Dive into Spring Core, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data for comprehensive back-end
development.
Hibernate and JPA: Understand object-relational mapping (ORM), entity management, and querying databases.
RESTful Web Services: Learn to create and consume RESTful services using Spring Boot and Jersey.
Security: Explore Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
Advanced Topics
Microservices Architecture: Understand the principles of microservices, and learn how to develop them using Spring Boot.
Distributed Systems and Cloud Services: Familiarize yourself with cloud service providers like AWS or Azure, and
understand how to deploy Java applications.
Containerization: Learn about Docker and Kubernetes for containerizing and orchestrating your applications.
Front-End Development with React
Basics of Web Development
HTML & CSS: Solidify your understanding of HTML5 and CSS3 for structuring and styling web pages.
JavaScript (ES6 and beyond): Get comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals, including ES6 features like arrow functions,
promises, async/await, and modules.
React Fundamentals
React Core Concepts: Learn about JSX, components, props, state, and the component lifecycle.
Hooks: Understand hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer for state management and side effects in
functional components.
Routing: Use React Router for navigation within your application.
State Management
Context API: Manage global state using the Context API.
Redux: Dive deeper into state management with Redux and middleware like Redux Thunk or Saga for asynchronous actions.
Advanced React
Performance Optimization: Learn techniques to optimize performance, including memoization, lazy loading, and
virtualization.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
TypeScript with React: Understand the benefits of using TypeScript for type safety and how to integrate it with React
projects.
Modern Tools and Libraries
Styling: Explore CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
Next.js: Learn about Next.js for server-side rendering, static site generation, and building full-stack applications.
Deployment and Scaling
Build and Deployment: Familiarize yourself with tools like Webpack, Babel, and services like Vercel or Netlify for
deploying React applications.
Progressive Web Apps (PWA): Understand the principles of PWAs for offline capability and installability.
