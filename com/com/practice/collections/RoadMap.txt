Roadmap for the Collections framework:

1.List Implementations: ArrayList vs LinkedList
2.What is the Java Collections Framework and why is it important?
3.How do you initialize an ArrayList and a LinkedList in Java?
4.What are the primary differences between ArrayList and LinkedList in terms of their data structures?
5.How does the choice between ArrayList and LinkedList affect the performance of adding elements to the list?
6.In what scenarios is ArrayList preferred over LinkedList for retrieval operations?
7.How do you iterate over an ArrayList and a LinkedList? Provide code examples.
8.What happens when you try to add an element to a full ArrayList?
9.How does the removal of elements from the middle of a list compare between ArrayList and LinkedList in terms of performance?
10.Can you store null values in an ArrayList and a LinkedList? Provide examples.
11. Write a code snippet to convert an ArrayList to an array and vice versa.
12. How do ArrayList and LinkedList handle duplicates?
13. Explain the significance of the ListIterator and how it can be used with LinkedList.
14. Discuss the memory usage differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.
15. What are the implications of using an ArrayList in a multi-threaded environment?
16. How do you synchronize an ArrayList and a LinkedList?
17. Set Implementations: HashSet vs TreeSet
18. What is the difference between a List and a Set in Java?
19. How do you initialize a HashSet and a TreeSet?
20. Can HashSet and TreeSet contain duplicate elements? Explain.
21. What are the performance implications of using HashSet vs TreeSet for add, remove, and search operations?
22. How does TreeSet maintain the order of its elements, and what is the role of the Comparable interface?
